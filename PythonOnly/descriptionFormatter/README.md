# DescriptionFormatter.py

## Origin and purpose

This is a program meant to help my church format video descriptions easily for good SEO & continutity with the click of a button.

## Hopes For This Project

I hope that this project will lead to seamless content creation for my church in the future. I also hope to explore many new concepts and gain familiarity with Python.

## Technical Goals

- [ ] Use a GUI for the first time (ever) in python
  - [ ] Dropdowns
  - [ ] Responsive Design
  - [ ] Ease of use
- [ ] Box program up in an easily runnable format ( .dmg if possible, since we use Macs)
- [x] Explore unit testing in Python
