# Ranked choice voting simulator

# Purpose
I wanted to do this to simulate how a Ranked-choice election would operate. I think it it helpful to have a way for someone to see it, and see the effects as opposed to our current system. 
Seeing the effects and would maybe make the idea itself more tangible and accessible.

# Implementation
...I'm gonna be honest here: I have NO idea.
