# BitOperations program
Idea came from my Intro to Computer Organization class, taken at SCSU in tha fall of 2020.
This program does all of the basic bit shift operations: logical, arithmetic, and circular shifts.

# What this progam helped me with:

* [X] Classes
* [X] Modular functionality
* [X] Exceptions (still a lot to learn here)
* [X] Comp sci concepts
* [X] Public Enums (Enums are actually great, why didn't I use them earlier?)

# What's left to do?
* [] A GUI (pain in the ass, but it would be nice)

## Try the program out, suggestions are welcome!
